      An overwhelming number of Americans are in Support of Universal Background Checks
    </p>
    
    <p>
      A multitude of studies have been conducted and have determined that the majority of those questioned were primarily in favor of Universal Background Checks or an alternative method of gun control. This spans over all demographic groups, including those who own guns themselves. In 2013, polls found that 90% of Americans supported and expansion on the current background checks. 
      In a study published by the New England Journal of Medicine, 89% of Americans and in 84% of gun owners supported Universal Background Checks in 2013.

  <p>
    It has been proven over and over that more guns leads to more death by guns.
    </p>
       
  <p>  
    The Society for Epidemiologic Research and John Hopkins Center reviewed 130 studies on gun control and found that increasing gun control also lowered the deaths by guns
They found that "Laws restricting the purchase of (e.g., background checks) and access to (e.g., safer storage) firearms are also associated with lower rates of intimate partner homicides and firearm unintentional deaths in children, respectively." 
    In another study by the John Hopkins Center, they found that the repeal of background checks in Missouri lead to an increase in the number of homocides by guns. In the years between 2008-2012 there was an additional 48 to 68 murders <b> per year</b> and a 25% increase in firearm homicide rates after the permit-to-purchase act was repealed in 2007.
    Additionally the Harvard injury Control Research Center studied relationship between access to guns/firearms and homicides from all 50 states over 10 years and found a strong correlation between access to guns and the number of deaths by guns, despite differing factors including different economic status, age, etc.

      Gun Control Limits Domestic Abuse
    </h2>
 <p>
   Women in the United States are 11 times more likely to be murdered with guns than women in other high-income countries. 
   The presence of a firearm during a domestic violence incident increases the likelihood of a homicide by 500 percent. 
   Domestic violence results in at least 2,000 deaths each year in the United States and more than half of the these “intimate partner” homicides are carried out with a gun.
   By prohibiting abusers access to guns, thousands of womens lives will be saved.
